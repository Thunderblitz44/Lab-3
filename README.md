(https://usgc.ontariotechu.ca/policy/policy-library/policies/academic/academic-integrity-policy.php) which
sets out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, including plagiarism, copying or
allowing one’s own work to copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and tests, submitting work
prepared in collaboration with another student when such collaboration has not been authorized, among
other academic offences.
○ I, ADAM FIFIELD, understand that a lack of familiarity with these regulations on academic conduct does
not constitute a defense against its application.
○ I, ADAM FIFIELD, attest that I have completed the [LAB XX: TITLE] requirements on my own and the
work submitted is my own original work
